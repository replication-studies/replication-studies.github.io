        <h2>About the Journal</h2>
        <p>The Journal of Fair Replication Studies (JFRS) is an Open-Access with a focus on replication studies in the social sciences. We aim to
          promote transparency, collaboration, and high standards in research by providing a platform for researchers to publish and review
          replication studies.</p>
        <p> The word "fair" in our title refers to our commitment to fair pay for editors and reviewers, fair access to published papers, fair and
          transparent peer-review processes, and fair academic critiques in the studies published here.</p>
        <p>Our ISBN number is 978-1-7380675-1-0 , and we are registered with Library and Archives Canada.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul class="goal-list">
            <li><span class="emoji">ðŸ”“</span> <strong>Open Access</strong> - All papers published in JFRS are freely accessible and licensed under
              the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the
              original work is properly cited.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">ðŸ«¡</span> <strong>Fair Pay & High Standards</strong> - We believe in fairly compensating editors and reviewers
              for their work while maintaining rigorous peer-review standards. We actively look for people interested in freelancing, in the same
              style as the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> but paid by the author or his/her institution.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">ðŸ’»</span> <strong>GitHub-Based Platform</strong> - Authors submit their replication studies via GitHub, allowing
              for transparent and public reviews, with all revisions and feedback accessible to the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submit a Paper</h2>
        <p>To submit your paper, check the <a href="https://github.com/replication-studies/submissions">submissions repository</a> for detailed
          instructions.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why another journal?</h2>
      <p>We believe that there is a need for a dedicated journal that focuses exclusively on replication studies in the social sciences. By providing
        a platform for researchers to publish and review replication studies in the social sciences. The <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of
          Open Source Software</a> sets a good precedent for short form articles about software (1-2 pages), and here we aim to expand to long form
          articles that provide detailed findings and code (e.g., 5, 10 or more pages), similar to <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with
            Code</a> that has a focus on Machine Learning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does this journal provide a DOI?</h2>
      <p>Yes, all papers published in JFRS will be assigned a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to ensure that they are citable and discoverable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is the journal indexed in any databases?</h2>
      <p>Not yet, but we are working on it. We aim to have JFRS indexed in major databases such as Scopus. The <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of
          Open Source Software</a> is not indexed either, nor is <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with Code</a> platform, but they are
        widely recognized.</p>
